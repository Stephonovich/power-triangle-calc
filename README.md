# power-triangle-calc
Performs calculations for Power Triangle and graphically displays results.

Works with 2.7 and 3.5, although the reported values look a little kludgy in 2.7 due to dictionary iteration differences.

Requires matplotlib for plotting, tkinter for input, and pymsgbox for a notification which could/should be implemented differently.
